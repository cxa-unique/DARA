137411	definition of products photosynthesis	8153025	Cyclic Electron Transport in Photosynthesis Photophosphorylation refers to the use of light energy to ultimately provide the energy to convert ADP to ATP, thus replenishing the universal energy currency in living things. In the simplest systems in prokaryotes, photosynthesis is used just for the production of energy, and not for the building of any biological molecules. In these systems there is a process called cyclic photophosphorylation, which just accomplishes the ADP to ATP process for immediate energy for these cells. This process uses only Photosystem I and the chlorophyll P700. The above sketch of the cyclic process is patterned after a visualization in Moore, et al.

975775	where in the genes is the disorder located	5867679	Autosomal dominant is one of several ways that a trait or disorder can be passed down (inherited) through families. In an autosomal dominant disease, if you inherit the abnormal gene from only one parent, you can get the disease. Often, one of the parents may also have the disease. Inheriting a disease, condition, or trait depends on the type of chromosome affected (autosomal or sex chromosome). It also depends on whether the trait is dominant or recessive. A single abnormal gene on one of the first 22 nonsex (autosomal) chromosomes from either parent can cause an autosomal disorder. Dominant inheritance means an abnormal gene from one parent can cause disease, even though the matching gene from the other parent is normal.
