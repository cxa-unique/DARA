If a cell goes through mitosis, the ideal result is the two offspring each have the same number of chromosomes as the parent. So if a diploid cell has 32 chromosomes, its 2 offspring will also have 32 chromosomes in each cell. B) There are 12 in total after 3 diploid cells go through meiosis. Meiosis produces 4 offspring since it goes through divisions (Meiosis I and Meiosis II). ----> 3 cells * 4 offspring = 12 cells in total.
